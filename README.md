# Worlds Worst Text Editor
This is the worlds worst text editor. I wrote this as a fun little project in order to learn lua. You can use to edit anything from txt to python files. But beware this editor is bare bones and when I say bare bones I mean bare bones.

### file name >>
Input file you would like to edit. If file does not exist a file will be created.

### line count >>
Input the amount of lines you would like to write. (Yes that is how bare bones it is)
